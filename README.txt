Summary:

Vision: Improve the ability for BSU students to engage themselves in pursuing
career opportunities through a web-based portfolio.

Essentially, the BSU WebFolio is place where students can create an online
portfolio of their academic and extra-curricular work.

The BSU WebFolio is being developed locally using WAMP and managed online via
Github. The WebFolio site is using Wordpress with Buddypress plugins to provide
functionality for students.
